## Overview

Developed a predictive model to minimize passenger disruption and reduce airline re-routing costs by identifying high-risk flight connections.


## Key Features

- **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Analyzed a dataset of over **15 million records** to identify key delay patterns.
- **High-Accuracy Modeling**: Implemented an **XGBoost** regressor that achieved an overall accuracy of **90%**.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified route congestion and scheduled timing as primary predictors, allowing for proactive rerouting decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **XGBoost**: For high-performance gradient boosting.
- **Pandas & Scikit-learn**: For data manipulation and model evaluation.

## Outcome

The model successfully pinpointed key variables in flight logistics, providing a data-driven approach to scheduling and connection management.

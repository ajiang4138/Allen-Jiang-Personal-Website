## Overview

During my remote internship at **Planetway**, I focused on building high-performance web applications that visualize complex data sets for corporate sustainability.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Developed a responsive frontend using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to visualize over **8,000 monthly data points**.
- **Scalable Backend**: Engineered a **Supabase** backend utilizing Row Level Security (RLS) and optimized SQL queries for high-speed data access.
- **Carbon Tracking**: Collaborated on a platform for companies to track carbon footprints, featuring secure authentication and cloud-based reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & TypeScript**: For building a type-safe, performant frontend architecture.
- **Supabase**: Used for scalable database management and secure user authentication.
- **Vercel**: For CI/CD and hosting the production environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For creating a modern, responsive user interface.

## Outcome

Successfully reduced database retrieval latency to sub-second levels, directly accelerating the rendering speed of data visualizations for end-users.

summary: "Developing a 2D Zelda-like game in Python with custom mechanics, including dodge-roll systems and resource management."

## Overview

Developed a top-down 2D action game inspired by the mechanics of classic Zelda titles. The project focused on implementing smooth player movement and combat systems entirely within **Python**.

## Key Features

- **Custom Combat Mechanics**: Implemented a dodge-roll mechanic featuring invulnerability frames to improve player survivability and movement during play.
- **Resource Management**: Developed "mana flask" and "health flask" systems to manage player sustainability and ability usage.
- **Top-Down Engine**: Built the game using a custom engine approach in Python, focusing on foundational mechanics and environment functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language used for all game logic, physics, and state management.
- **Pygame**: Utilized for rendering 2D graphics, handling input, and managing the game loop.

## Outcome

Successfully created a functional 2D adventure game, expanding upon foundational tutorials by implementing custom gameplay logic and original mechanics like the dodge-roll system.

## Current Development
- While the game is in a playable state, there are still many mechanics and features yet to be implemented. My current focus on the game is the introduction
 of a finite state machine for a simple enemy AI.

## Future Development
- More weapons, skills, enemies
- Introducing a questline and improving the map
- Other custom mechanics inspires by Souls-like series, such as armor, inventory, and leveling resources as currency
